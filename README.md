**PROJECT BACKGROUND:**

As a new hire Data Engineer, the first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. In this project, I have designed tables to hold data in the 6 CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and perform data analysis.

1. Data Engineering | Data Modeling

2. Data Analysis

**THE OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**

i) Employee_ERD.png depicts the ERD of the tables.

ii) Tables.sql is containing my codes in SQL languages to query the data


iii) Analysis.sql is the codes for data modeling

iv) .ipynb checkpoints: Jupyter notebook contains codes and graphs for salary vs title analysis


**Requirements and Methodology:**

In carry out the analysis the following tools/resources were used:

i) http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com

ii) SQL | PgAdmin4

iii) SQLAlchemy

v) Python | Matplotlib

**Findings:**

The most common salary range is 40k-50k followed by 60-70k in the company.
Only a few employees receive salary above 100k.

Overall, the company has a rather fair payroll range for its employees and it seems to be fair across the titles too.
