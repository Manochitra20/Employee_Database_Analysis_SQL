1. Data Engineering | Data Modeling

2. Data Analysis

**THE OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**

i) the .sql is containing my codes in SQL languages to query the data

ii) the schema.sql is the codes for data modeling

iii) .ipynb checkpoint: Jupiternotebook contains my codes and charts for salary vs title analysis

iv) Outputs | Data: the outputs and resources as csv files and chart from my works

**Requirements and Methodology:**

In carry out the analysis the following tools/resources were used:

**Findings:**

The average salary group by job titles in the Company;



the most common salary range is 40k which is belong to more than 40 thousands staff in the company;

the next range is from 50K to 70K that's falling into nearly 40 thousands staff.

the less frequency of salary range is from 110K that just rewarding to less than 1 thousand people in the Company.

Overall, the Company has a rather fair payroll range for its employees. It would be great if its benefits and allowances come in good package.
